# Fake-News
This project focuses on predicting whether a news article can be considered fake or real. This has been done using natural language processing, also known as NLP, as well as models and algorithms, which have been trained on a large dataset and therefore can make some predictions.

# Data
All the data used for this project is from the Fake News Corpus (https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus/releases/tag/v1.0), which contains ~ 27gb unzipped data, with about ~ 9 million rows of content, type, author and so forth. 

# Requirements
To run the code in the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file, you first of all have to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. 
This also includes different libraries such as sklearn (see requirements.txt for more info). All of these can be installed using 'pip'

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates different NLP techniques, how these work and how the statistics from this can be usefull. We then train different baseline- and advanced models up against each other, and hyperoptimate optimize the one which did best (with no errors!).
